                 <h3>Project 1</h3>
                 <p>Part 1 - Nametag</p>
                 <p>The first print that I worked on was the keychain, I found this to be a relatively easy print because the template was pre-made and all we had to edit was the name. This print was done on the Prusa mini using the Prusa native software for slicing. The settings used during the print were .15mm speed presets, no supports/brim, 15% infill, PLA filament, and 3.6 grams of used filament. The print went well with no problems in the workflow, simply slicing the template and uploading the files onto the USB for the printer was all that was required. The final product of the print was solid with only a little bit of accuracy lacking in the small details of the letters along with some stringing there, which I assume is because of the tiny size of the print and the speed preset used, besides this though it was a successful print.</p>

                <p>Part 2 - Second Print/Stress Test</p>
                <p>The second print for this project was the stress test print with the idea of the print being to push the prusa mini to its maximum capabilities where it will surely fail. For this print, I got the stl file from thang.com by typing in “stress test” and picking one that measured many different printing settings as well as having overhanging pieces. Settings used were .15mm structural presets, no supports, 15% infill, and PLA filament. The final print did ultimately fail with a lot of stringing all across rendering the details of the print non legible. My main assumption is that this is due to the size of the print, being that it is so small the printer is having a hard time making the key components of the print small as well. Although, considering the point was to make a failed print I would say that this print was successful.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>For this project, the primary objective was to take a concept from sketch to reality by using Tinkercad and Fusion360 to edit existing publicly available.STL &.3MF files. We began by searching for a model to base our idea on thangs.com. I found my model relatively quickly which is the Eiffel Tower, being that I had a concept that resonated with me beforehand. Once I saw the model I decided to sketch a bent version of the Eiffel Tower (inspired by the Leaning Tower of Pisa) to represent the nature of capitalist economies being bent against populist interest. Once I loaded my model up in Tinkercad to start, I quickly realized that my sketch would not be able to print exactly how I imagined it; however, I used it as a starting point to continue the design. After some playing around in the TInkercad software, I came up with the idea of the Eiffel Tower being tilted on the block with the saying “da ppl” which brought me to a more interesting meaning. So while still representing the themes of capitalism as discussed before, this final version of the design represents how younger generations can overcome the negative aspects of our economies if we rise as a collective. Structurally, the design allowed for the print to be built with stable but not excessive support while also maintaining the structure of the tower during the print without collapsing which the original sketch may have done. After I finalized the design I printed the model in blue filament which you can see in the below pictures along with all CAD workflow slices in Tinkercad, PrusaSlicer, and Fusion360. The print was successful with no apparent problems and I used the settings .15mm speed, PLA filament, 15% infill, no brim, and supports everywhere, with 10.37 grams of used filament. After that print, I loaded the file into Fusion360 in which I made the model a little bit larger and uploaded it back into Prusa for another print using the same settings except with 19.58 grams of used filament. This print ended up being successful as well and it was printed with white filament. In the future, I would close the gap between the tower and the block so I do not need to rely on support to hold it. Besides that, I am very satisfied with the final results and again you can find all the pictures below.</p>

           <h3>Project 3</h3>
           <p>For this project the primary objective was to bring a sketch to reality for a battery pack powered alarm clock by using Fusion 360 to design multiple versions of a chassis created via laser cutting and 3d printing. We did this in addition to through hole soldering the components of the circuit board.</p>
           <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
           <p>The project caused us to run into a few complications when creating buttons for the chassis during the 3d print however, once we decided on a simpler design our lives were made much easier. We decided to go with a design that would allow for the buttons to get easy access, in addition to the clock screen being clearly visible on through the chassis. For our prints we ran the settings; .15mm speed, 15 percent infill, with no brim or supports and the final chassis made took about an hour to print. One important note is the difference from our final green chassis design and our initial sketch from which we decided on making the hole for the buttons in the chassis later in our design process, I just think it is interesting to see that evolution happening. Below you will find all 3d print related and sketch photos.</p>

           <p>For the laser cutting portion of the project we had a bit of difficulty creating the finger joints required for the chassis as my partner was making them manually. As a result, the finger joints didnt fit the exact measurements in some parts and due ot restrictions on time we ended up compromising buy deciding to just glue in the circuit board with another wood piece behind to keep it from shifting inside our enclosure. Once we glued in everything it was pretty simple and we ended up moving the battery pack on the outside of the chassis for space reasons and accessibility to change the batteries. Another important note here is that we had to runa second laser cut to make a larger top and bottom piece in order to support the build measurements with this new solution but that did not pose too much of a difficulty. Below here are all laser cut related photos.</p>

        <h3>Project 4</h3>
        <p>Throughout the development of this project, the reading that really resonated with me from the class is the Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit. This toolkit really emphasizes the importance and value of having empathy and understanding when addressing your users' needs in the design process. One powerful quote from that shows this "Inclusive design means understanding the needs of different people and designing products that work for as many as possible." Due to this, I couldn't help but feel disappointed when I considered that although we made this project, at no point did we consider or have direct dialogue with anyone disabled to know if this design is worthwhile for the intended user. I assume it is, however assumption seems to be a major flaw in the design process of many products and services.</p>
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        <p>The ultimate end goal was to print and assemble a fully functional, 3d printed prosthetic hand. We decided to go with one of the standard models as defined in the project description which was the Phoenix Hand V3. Our methodology for assembly and printing went much simpler than expected. We decided to print all of the smaller pieces in one print and we decided to print the palm and bracket piece individually by themselves under the settings  .15mm speed, PLA filament, 15% infill, no brim, supports everywhere with the overall print time amounting to about 10 hours for the smaller piece print and 2 hours for the bracket and palm piece respectively. After the print was completed we removed the supports which provided a slight challenge as we did not need to print with supports at all because they filled up tiny holes in the pieces that we had to use filers and pliers to remove. However, this dilemma did not stop our progress and we were able to assemble the hand following the provided instruction guide and a youtube video provided by NIH on the assembly.</p>

        <img src = "./assets/small.png" alt="f1" width="320" height="320">

        <img src = "./assets/finalhand3.jpg" alt="f1" width="320" height="320">
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        <p>After successfully printing and assembling the hand, we then proceeded to the next step of the project which was to create a modification to the existing design that we thought would improve functionality. We decided to add an extra bump to the grove that allows the tensioner to slide on to the palm piece in either direction. Allowing for easy assembly regardless of the orientation of either piece. This design feature would help someone on the assembly side more than anything. However, we can think of a situation where someone who is trying to print a hand for themselves would potentially have an easier time in said assembly process because of this added functionality.</p>

        <h3>Scavenger Hunt</h3>
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        <p>For this project, the primary objective was to go around campus and find different designs that align with the various descriptions you will see below, essentially a standard scavenger hunt as the name suggests. You will also find pictures of the referred to designs as well as brief notations on them.</p>
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        <h3>Designs for access</h3>
        <p>1. Design for navigation without one or more of the 5 senses- Braille for those who can’t read the signs - If you can not see because of blindness, you can use the braille on the door to tell you the room number</p>
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        <p>2. Design for forms of assistance, broadly defined - Emergency call tower - Tower that can be used to make a direct call to the police in case of emergency. In this photo they were covered due to repairs but have since become available.</p>
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        <p>3. Design for aging, broadly defined - Elevator to traverse floors easily for those who have a hard time climbing stairs - Older people tend to have problems with steep stairs especially like the ones in the physics building where this elevator is located.</p>    
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        <p>4. Design for young children (no parks or playgrounds) - Child sized urinal</p>
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        <p>5. Design for wheeled mobile gear (chairs, bikes, strollers, etc.) - Accessibility button that allows for wheelchairs to pass through doors more easily - Button allows for the door to open automatically</p>
